Implement real-time automated responses (e.g., isolating compromised devices, disabling accounts) based on pre-defined incident types and severity levels.

Ensure Cortex SOAR is configured to provide alerts, reports, and updates on incident status, response actions, and resolution times.

Monitor the effectiveness of automated responses and adjust playbooks and workflows as needed to improve incident response quality.

Workflow Optimization and Customization:

Analyze existing SOC workflows and identify opportunities to enhance efficiency through automation.

Customize and create new playbooks to address evolving threats, new attack techniques, and changes in client environments.

Work with clients and SOC teams to implement custom use cases and integrations specific to individual client security requirements.

Monitoring and Reporting:

Monitor the performance of Cortex SOAR playbooks and workflows to ensure they are executing correctly and improving SOC efficiency.

Generate reports and dashboards on automated incident handling metrics (e.g., time saved, incidents resolved via automation).

Provide regular updates to SOC management on the effectiveness of automation efforts and recommend improvements.

Ensure detailed logging and reporting of all automated actions taken by the SOAR platform to meet compliance and audit requirements.

Collaboration with SOC Teams:

Collaborate with SOC analysts, threat intelligence, and incident response teams to refine and develop automation strategies.

Provide training to SOC analysts and incident responders on how to leverage Cortex SOAR effectively in day-to-day operations.

Act as the technical point of contact for troubleshooting issues related to Cortex SOAR integrations, playbooks, and platform performance.
